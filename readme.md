Writing the version using the JQuery library ended up being pretty much
the same and not any easier than writing the VanillaJS version. 

The file size of the JQuery version is 337.4KB while the VanillaJS version
is 254.6KB. 

The load times of the JQuery version is 198ms while for the VanillaJS
version it is 166ms. 

We used TrackJS to automatically log errors and to check if javascript is loaded in the user browser, 
and if not, it outputs an error to us.
